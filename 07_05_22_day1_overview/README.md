# Overview Day led by Sabera Talukder and Adi Nair

This day covers three topics that focus on computational basis: 

In Dimensionality Reduction, you will learn to perform principal components analysis (PCA) using sklearn and then learn to implement this by matrix factorization techniques such as eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition on an example neural dataset.

In Overfitting & Regularization, you will learn to predict behavior from neural activity using linear and logistic regression and learn how to overcome overfitting using regularization technqiues. 

In the final session, you will learn how to handle common problems in datasets such as class imbalances, missing data and noise
