    "# Background concepts\n",
    "A neuron can be thought of as a bubble that isolates its internal environment from its surroundings. By expressing an assortment of channels in its membrane, it can transport ions and molecules across the bubble wall, at the cost of some energy. The resulting concentration and charge gradient across the cell membrane is a store of potential energy that the cell can take advantage of to do interesting things- like fire action potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a reversal potential?\n",
    "The resting membrane potential of a neuron is determined by a finely tuned balance of ion conductances- predominantly sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+). In the absence of any external input, each ion experiences two competing \"forces\" across the cell's membrane: a chemical force that tries to equilize the concentration of the ion inside vs outside of the membrane, and an electrical force that tries to equilize charges inside vs outside the membrane. Neurons also posess a collection of \"ion pumps\" that transport charged ions across the cell membrane in a way that maintains a concentration differential inside vs outside of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **[Nernst Equilibrium Potential](https://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/resting_membrane_potential/resting_membrane_potential_nernst_equilibrium_potential.html)**, or **reversal potential**, is balance of these two forces, aka the net charge difference (or voltage) across the cell membrane at which concentration and charge forces on a given ion are balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a conductance?\n",
    "Conductance is simply defined as 1/resistance, meaning it is a measure of how easy it is for charge to flow from one point to another. In neuroscience, we often measure the conductance of different ions across the cell membrane. Neurons produce specialized ion channels that allow specific ions to pass through them, entering from the outside to the inside of the cell (or vice versa). The more ion channels there are in the membrane, the more ions can flow through it, and thus the higher the membrane conductance for that ion. Some ion channels are \"gated\", meaning that they only allow the flow of ions in certain conditions: these allow neurons to switch from a low to a high ion conductance when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ion_channel.jpg](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GKS1BynnRm2odGRuCwS6LUIAHFuPcXXk)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens during an action potential?\n",
    "An action potential is the magic of gated ion channels in action. Specifically, neurons have a population of *voltage-gated* ion channels, that open and close as a function of the difference in charge across the cell membrane (what is called the *membrane potential*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any single ion channel is only going to be open or closed at a given time, but as a *population*, the proportion of open channels for a particular ion will evolve as a function of time and membrane potential. During an action potential, a series of voltage-gated channels for various ions open and close in a particular order, causing a rapid depolarization of the neuron followed by a repolarization stage that brings things back to the cell's resting potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hodgkin and Huxley built a model of how the membrane potential of a squid giant axon evolves following an injection of current- seen below, the top plot is the membrane potential (showing two action potentials), and the bottom row is the current injection.\n",
    "![source: https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exercises/hodgkin-huxley.html](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AoJD2snOLCFJXcQHeO1ZIlB490Xhdhmv)([source](https://neuronaldynamics-exercises.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exercises/hodgkin-huxley.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "The three lines in the middle plot represent the activations of three intervening parameters: H&H didn't know it at the time, but these very closely capture the opening and closing dynamics of ion channels in the cell membrane. It is these time-evolving signals that collectively give rise to the fluctionations of the neuron membrane potential in the top trace."

    "# The Morris-Lecar model\n",
    "Most neuroscientists know the story of the [Hodgkin Huxley model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) and the squid giant axon. But  you can get nearly the same range of spiking behaviors with half the parameters: enter the **Morris-Lecar model**, one of the most popular conductance-based models in neuroscience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar from recordings of the [giant acorn barnacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanus_nubilus), this model captures the spiking dynamics of neurons in terms of two dynamical parameters: a membrane potential $V$ and a recovery variable $W$, the latter of which captures the fraction of open potassium ion channels in the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because potassium ion channels open/close more slowly than other voltage-gated channels, they become a rate-limiting step for action potentials; by comparison, all other ion channels can be assumed to achieve their steady-state values instantaneously. This separation of timescales is what allows Morris and Lecar to describe the entire action potential generation process in terms of only two parameters.\n",

    "## Introducing the model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to take a pre-written simulation of the Morris-Lecar model and play around with it to see what it does. The Morris-Lecar model is defined by the following pair of diffential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  C \\frac{dV}{dt} & ~=~ - g_\\mathrm{Ca} M_\\mathrm{ss}(V) (V-V_\\mathrm{Ca}) - g_\\mathrm{K} W (V-V_\\mathrm{K}) - g_\\mathrm{L} (V-V_\\mathrm{L}) + I\\\\[5pt]\n",
    "  \\frac{dW}{dt} & ~=~ \\frac{W_\\mathrm{ss}-W}{T_\\mathrm{W}(V)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the biophysical parameters: $C$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_\\mathrm{Ca}$, $g_\\mathrm{K}$, and $g_\\mathrm{L}$ are ion-specific conductances (\"L\" is a leak conductance, basically a catch-all for all ions other than potassium and calcium), and $V_\\mathrm{Ca}$, $V_\\mathrm{K}$, and $V_\\mathrm{L}$ are corresponding ion-specific reversal potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels are captured by $M_\\mathrm{ss}(V)$ and $W$, describing how calcium and potassium conductances change as a function of the membrane potential $V$. $M_\\mathrm{ss}(V)$ is called that because it is fast compared to $W$, effectively instantly reaching its *steady-state* value (hence the *ss*).\n",
    "\n",
    "$W$ evolves more slowly- the second equation shows the dynamics by which it reaches its steady-state value $W_\\mathrm{ss}(V)$ as a function of time. Our remaining parameter $T_\\mathrm{W}(V)$ captures just that, the membrane-potential-dependent-rate at which $W$ approaches $W_\\mathrm{ss}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the last bit of equations- we have to define $M_\\mathrm{ss}(V)$, $W_\\mathrm{ss}(V)$, and $T_\\mathrm{W}(V)$. These are defined in terms of five parameters that Morris and Lecar fit to their data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "M_\\mathrm{ss}(V) & ~=~ (1 + \\tanh[(V-V_1)/V_2])/2\\\\\n",
    "W_\\mathrm{ss}(V) & ~=~ (1 + \\tanh[(V-V_3)/V_4])/2\\\\\n",
    "T_\\mathrm{W}(V) & ~=~ 1/\\cosh[(V-V_3)/(2V_4)]\\\\\n",
