# High Dimensional Data Day led by Ann Kennedy and Xuan Ma


During the hands-on session, you will be working with some monkey data, including both cortical and muscular signals. Here is a brief outline.
* Backgrounds about experimental paradigm and signal processing
* Data loading and exploring
* Data visualization
* Dimensionality reduction
	* Basic use of PCA
	* Understand PCA
	* Visualize low-D representations of the neural signals
* Exploring the relationship between M1 neurons and upper limb muscles
	* Linear decoder (Wiener filter)
	* Adding static nonlinearity (Wiener cascade)
	* Nonlinear decoder (neural networks)
		* Basic coding with PyTorch
		* Hyperparameter turning
* Combining what you learned for both dimensionality reduction and neural decoder. 
	* Building decoders to predict EMGs from low-D latent signals
