# Single Cell and Hypothesis Testing Day led by Lior Pachter and Tara Chari

In this workshop we will explore the basics of matrix operations and regression with single-cell data, how to measure gene-gene or cell-cell relationships through correlation and distance metrics, and how to do model selection when representing single-cell gene counts.

The code folder contains notebooks for (1) applying regression models to single cell data (e.g. linear/logistic regression and partial correlation calculations) and (2) fitting the relevant count distributions to single-cell data and assessing the properties of the count data.

The misc folder contains handwritten exercises for understanding basic properties of expectation and matrix algebra in the context of regression and correlation.
